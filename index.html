                    Mad Libs: Many of us played with Mad Libs as kids. The idea is to ask someone — a friend, a victim — for
                    some words, such as (1) a name, (2) a vehicle, (3) a restaurant, etc. Then, when you insert the
                    words into a story, it yields a crazy result, because the choices were made without any idea of what
                    the story would be.
                    <br>
                    Tom Thumb File Calculations: You are working as a summer intern at Tom Thumb ImageWorks, a company that specializes in
                    making thumbnails for images that its clients want to use on their websites.
                    To make sure that the size of the files is small, you are asked to write a form that will let the page
                    designer enter the desired values for width, height, and number of colors. Your form calculates the
                    file size for these values, and displays a message to notify the designer whether those values are
                    good for a small file or not.
