This Project is developed as a part of an assignment for Pre Internship Trainning 2024 - State Street

Part 1: Mad Libs
Many of us played with Mad Libs as kids. The idea is to ask someone — a friend, a victim — for
some words, such as (1) a name, (2) a vehicle, (3) a restaurant, etc. Then, when you insert the
words into a story, it yields a crazy result, because the choices were made without any idea of what
the story would be.

Part 2: Tom Thumb File Calculations
You are working as a summer intern at Tom Thumb ImageWorks, a company that specializes in
making thumbnails for images that its clients want to use on their websites.
To make sure that the size of the files is small, you are asked to write a form that will let the page
designer enter the desired values for width, height, and number of colors. Your form calculates the
file size for these values, and displays a message to notify the designer whether those values are
good for a small file or not.
